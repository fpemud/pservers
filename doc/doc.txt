TODO:
1. changes to ".private" domain name
2. active-active


pserver contains 2 kinds of servers:
1. embeded server: 
2. external server: use pserver as a proxy


write account can commit change so that pserver can sync to other pservers to implement active-active.
after commit, server will record digest for its content, so that conflict can be reported in synchronization.
git-annex is used as implementation for file data, and keeps some old data, we use this to replace the need for backup.


pserver can advertise "pserver._tcp" by avahi.
this advertisement is used by active-active only. human user or other client should access by domain name.
