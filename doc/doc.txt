TODO:
1. request dedicated ip address if needed (port conflict)
2. active-active

server base:
1. plugin-based server
2. config-based server

server type:
1. file          http r/w, ftp r
2. git           http r/w, git r

every server has read account and write account.
write account can edit the content in the server.

write account can commit change so that pserver can sync to other pservers to implement active-active.
after commit, server will record digest for its content, so that conflict can be reported in synchronization.
git-annex is used as implementation for file data, and keeps some old data, we use this to replace the need for backup.


pserver can advertise "pserver._tcp" by avahi.
this advertisement is used by active-active only. human user or other client should access by domain name.
